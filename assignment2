## The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

## 1) set the value of the vector
## 2) get the value of the vector
## 3) set the value of the mean
## 4) get the value of the mean


## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrixless 
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
## Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix:
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(solveMatrix) inv <<- solveMatrix
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)}


## cachesolve:
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv      
}
